# sbndPRISM

A study to inspect wheather the direct relationship between the neutrino beam off-axis angle and the neutrino energy can be taken advantage off to create pseudo-mono-chromatic energy fluxes. 

Refer to sbncode - Production and analysis framework for SBN (https://github.com/nuchicago/sbncode)  
Based on the nuPRISM paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3086).
