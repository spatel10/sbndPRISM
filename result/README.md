Results from some of the fits using the ana_prism.C macro and the output_sbndPRSIM.root (output from sbncode)

Divided into True and Reco and each of them further divided into whether the sample contains all non-qe (nonqe) interactions, interactions with MEC switched off (nomec)

The file names are sufficiently self-explanatory (based on the user input mean and sigma for the fake-gaussian)
